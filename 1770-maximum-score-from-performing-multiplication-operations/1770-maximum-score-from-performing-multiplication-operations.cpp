Intuition:
The maximum score is the maximum of the sum of the first i elements of nums and the last i elements of nums. Thus, we require something like a dp that stores the maximum score for the first i elements of nums and the last i elements of nums.

Approach:

Why do we need dp?
Because we need to find the maximum score for each i.
So we need to find the maximum score for each i-1 and then add the last element of multipliers to it.
So we need to find the maximum score for eachi-2 and then add the last two elements of multipliers to it & so on.
And dp is the best way to do that.
dp will be a 2d array of size (m+1)*(m+1) where m is the size of multipliers.
dp will store the maximum score for each i.
dp[i][j] will store the maximum score for the first i elements of nums and the last j elements of multipliers.
using dp we will make sure that we don't calculate the same thing twice
and we will calculate the maximum score for each i.
